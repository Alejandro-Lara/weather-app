This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Weather forecast app that I made to practice React Js.
It uses the geolocation api, and the openweathermaps.org api.
Api key is currently imported from the file config.js in the src directory. This file is excluded in the repository.
Currently working on an intermediary server to keep the api key hidden.
